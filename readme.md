## Stealthy Chat
This is a simple yet powerful chat application aiming for privacy and security

### How it works?
So there is the `server.py` file, that acts as a server and host the actual chat server and the `client.py` is the chat application itself.

> [!WARNING]
> You need to port forward if you are hosting the chat! (or use alternative methods like ngrok)

> [!WARNING]
> The server **CAN** see your IP Address and if you don't want or don't trust them - please use a VPN or a Tor connection

> [!NOTE]
> The server is a CLI application and client is a GUI Application
